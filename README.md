# BatoOnline
Bato Online is a small single page application (SPA), built to test HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS skills, and also teamwork skills.
Basically, the app is an online store which users can purchase from when they sign in.
The front-end is developed with HTML, Twitter Bootstrap, and CSS
What we will call the back-end is developed using AngularJS.
One of the aims of the task is to push AngularJS as far as possible, as a back-end tool.
The main goal of this task is to test teamwork skills while having fun doing what we love.
The task will keep evolving.
